# Disco Labels

### Description

This project was created as a tool for Discogs sellers to easily create 2.575" x 1" labels for record shows. I used ReactJS because it offers an easy way to store state and maintain the single page layout used for the app. The biggest challenge faced when creating this project was repeating API calls to fetch the user's inventory, this approach however is limited to inventories with around 2000 listings. A future implementaion of fetching the user's inventory page by page would allow for larger inventories to be viable.

### How to use

Simply search for a Discogs user, select the records you wish to generate labels for, and print the labels once they load.
